# Logistic-Regression-and-KNN-Classifier
Skills: Python, K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Principal Component Analysis
Designed a classifier to determine if a breast cancer patients tumor was malignant or benign. Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and normalization to get a 3 dimensional representation of the classified data. Applied KNN and Logistic regression with Gradient Descent, to compare their performances on a test set. The KNN classifier had a better specificity while the classifier based on logistic regression had a better recall
